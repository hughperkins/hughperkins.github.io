I found the following quotation on [Cosma Shalizi's homepage](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/) today (26 Dec 2016).  I really like this :-)

"Why are students today not successful? What is the trouble? The trouble lies in their lack of self-confidence. If you do not have enough self-confidence, you will busily submit yourself to all kinds of external conditions and transformations, and be enslaved and turned around by them and lose your freedom. But if you can stop the mind that seeks [those external conditions] in every instant of thought, you will then be no different from the old masters." — Master I-hsüan
